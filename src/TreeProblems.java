   sumTree (Node Version)
   -----------
   Given a tree built with the Node class (with integer values), compute and return the sum of all the node values.
   Example:
   If the tree is:
          5
       /  |  \
      3   9   8
        / | \  
       4  1  2
   then the method should return 32.
   A null tree should return 0

  /*
   sumTree (Map Version)
   -----------
   Given a tree represented as a map (where every node appears as a key and leaf nodes map to an empty list),
   compute the sum of all nodes.
   Example:
   For a tree represented as:
     5 -> [3, 9, 8]
     3 -> []
     9 -> [4, 1, 2]
     4 -> []
     1 -> []
     2 -> []
   the method should return 32.

   A null tree should return 0

   Hint: There's a simple way to do this!

  /*
   findRoot
   -----------
   Given a tree represented as a map where each key is a parent node and the value is a list of its children,
   find the root of the tree. The root is the node with no parents.
   Example:
   If the tree is represented as:
     20 -> [40]
     8  -> []
     30 -> []
     10 -> [20, 30, 99]
     40 -> []
     99 -> [8]
   then the method should return 10.

  You can assume the tree is non-null and well-formed.

   Hint: No recursion needed! Think about how you would do this by hand.

  /*
   maxDepth (Node Version)
   -----------
   Compute the maximum depth of a tree using the Node class. The depth is the number of nodes along
   the longest path from the root down to the farthest leaf. The root is at depth 1. If the tree is null, return 0.
   Example:
   For a tree structured as:
          A
       /  |  \
      B   E   C
      |      / \
      E     D   Q
             \ 
              Z
   the maximum depth is 4.

   maxDepth (Map Version)
   -----------
   Compute the maximum depth of a tree using the Node class. The depth is the number of nodes along

   Example:

    B -> [E]
    E -> []
    C -> [D, Q]
    D -> [Z]
    Q -> []
    Z -> []
   the maximum depth is 4 (A->C->D->Z).

   Hint: Use findRoot to start. Then, make a recursive helper method.
